    <h3>Introduction to c++</h3>
    <p><h2>What is C++?</h2>
        <ul>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.</ul>
        
        <ul>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.</ul>
        
        <ul>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
        </ul>
       <ul >The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.</ul>
        </p>
       <p><h2> Why Use C++</h2>
        <ul>c++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</ul>
        
       <ul> C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.</ul>
        
        <ul>C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.</ul>
        
        <ul>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.</ul>
        
        <ul>C++ is fun and easy to learn!</ul>
        
        <ul>As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.</ul>
        </p>
        <p><h2>difference between C and C++</h2>
      <ul>  C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.
    </ul>  
        <ul>The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.
        </ul>
     <h2>  Get Started</h2> 
      <ul>  This tutorial will teach you the basics of C++.
    </ul>
        <ul>It is not necessary to have any prior programming experience.</ul>

    <h3>features of c++</h3>
    <p><ul>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include an object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and compiled language. C++ has a number of features, including:</ul>

     <ul>Object-Oriented Programming</ul>
      <ul>Machine Independent</ul>
      <ul>Simple</ul>
     <ul> High-Level Language</ul>
      <ul>Popular</ul>
    <ul>Case-sensitive</ul>  
    <ul>  Compiler Based</ul>
  <ul>    Dynamic Memory Allocation</ul>
    <ul>  Memory Management</ul>
     <ul> Multi-threading</ul></p>
     <p>
      <h2> 1.Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
       <ol> C++ is an Object-Oriented Programming Language, unlike C which is a procedural programming language. This is the most important feature of C++. It can create/destroy objects while programming. Also, It can create blueprints with which objects can be created. We have discussed the Object-Orient Programming Concepts in C++ in this article.
        </ol>
        <ol>Concepts of Object-oriented programming Language:</ol>
     </p>
     <p><ol>Class</ol>

      <ol>Objects</ol>
     <ol> Encapsulation</ol>
      <ol>Polymorphism</ol>
      <ol>Inheritance</ol>
      <ol>Abstraction</ol>
      <P><h2>2. Machine Independent</h2>
      A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however, they are machine-independent. Let us understand this feature of C++ with the help of an example. Suppose you have written a piece of code that can run on Linux/Windows/Mac OSx which makes the C++ Machine Independent but the executable file of the C++ cannot run on different operating systems.
      </P>
     <p><h2> 3. Simple</h2>
     <ol> It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has rich library support and has a variety of data types. Also, the Auto Keyword of C++ makes life easier.
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
       <ol><h2> Auto Keyword</h2>
The idea of the auto keyword was to form the C++ compiler to deduce the data type while compiling instead of making you declare the data type every freaking time. Do keep in mind that you cannot declare something without an initializer. There must be some way for the compiler to deduce your type.
       </ol>
<ol></ol>

  <div id="approach" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>The objects-oriented approach</h3>
    <p>Object oriented programming is a programming methodology that associates data 
      structures with set of operators which act upon it. In OOP, an instance of such an 
      entity is known as object. In other words, OOP is a method of implementation in 
      which programs are organized as co-operative collections of objects, each of which 
      represents and instance of some class are all members of hierarchy of classes united 
      through the property called inheritance. </p>
     <p> The OOP is an approach to program organization and development that attempts to 
      eliminate some of the pitfalls of conventional programming methods by 
      incorporating the best of structured programming features with powerful new 
      concepts. The object oriented approach is: </p>
      <p><ul><li> The recent concept among programming paradigms.</li>

      <li>Fundamental idea it to combine data and functions those operate on those 
      data into single unit-called object. </li>
      <li> The data of an object can be accessed only by the function associated with 
      these objects.</li></ul> </p>
     <p><h3> In OO Programming </h3>
      <o><li>Emphasis is on data rather than procedures.</li> 
      <li>
       Programs are divided into objects. </li>
      <li>Data is hidden and can't accessed by external functions. </li>
      <li>Data structures are designed such that, they characterize the objects. </li>
      <li> Functions and data are tied together in the data structures so that data 
      abstraction is introduced in addition to procedural abstraction. </li>
      <li> Object can communicate with each other through function. </li>
      <li> New data and function can be easily added. </li></p>
  </div>
  <div id="objects and classes" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>objects and classes</h3>
    <p>





    
     <p> There are various objects like book, box, computer, furniture etc. in real world. The 
      computers in our school lab or our home are similar objects. These different 
      computers may be manufactured by different companies in different models. They 
      have common characteristics to identify them. For example: all have memory, hard 
      disk, monitor, keyboard etc. </p>
     <p> The general or common name to describe objects of common or similar 
      characteristics and behaviors is called class. Thus the name 'computer' may be class 
      name which represents my personal computer, lab computer and other computers. A 
      class is blue print or template which describes characteristics of similar objects.</p> 
     <p> The main purpose of C++ programming is to add object orientation to the C 
      programming language and classes are the central feature of C++ that supports 
      object-oriented programming and are often called user-defined types. 
</p>

<p>A class is used to specify the form of an object and it combines data representation 
  and methods for manipulating that data into one neat package. The data and functions 
  within a class are called members of the class. </p>
  <p>The data types such as int, float, double may be class which represent similar data 
  items. For eg. Int represents all integer numbers such as 1, 2, 3,4 and so on. So, int 
  is general name for representation of any integer values. In OOP, we can define class 
  name to represent its individual objects. Defining a class in programming language 
  means creating user defined data type and it behaves like the built-in data types. Once 
  a class has been defined, we can create any number of objects belonging to that class. 
  An object is an instance of a class. A class is a description of a group of objects with 
  common properties (attributes or characteristics or variables), behavior (operations 
  or methods) and relationships. The possible classes may be book, student, employee, 
  bus, computer, vehicle, account and so on</p>

  </p>
      
        <h3>Accessing member of structures:-</h3>
        <p>The members of structure are usually processed individually, as separate entity. 
          Therefore, we must be able to access the individual structure members. A structure 
          member can be accessed by using period or dot (i.e. ".") operator. The syntax for 
          accessing member of a structure variable is as follows: </p>
          <h3>structure_variable members</h3>
          <p>Here, structure_variable refers to the name of a structure-type variable and member 
            refers to the name of a member within the structure. Again, dot separates the variable 
            name from the member name. The dot operator must have a structure variable on its 
            left and a legal member on its right. In the case of nested structure (if a structure 
            member is itself a structure), the member within inner structure is accessed as </p>
      <h3>Structure_variable.member.submember</h3>
      <p>
        i.e., structure_variable.member_of_outer_sturucture.member_of_inner_sturcture 
        Here is an example, demonstrating how to access members of a structure in C++ 
      <table><td>/* C++ Access Structure Member */ <br>
        #include<iostream.h> <br>
        #include<conio.h><br> 
        struct st <br>
        { <br>
         int a; // structure member <br>
         int b; // structure member <br>
         int sum; // structure member<br> 
        }st_var; // structure variable <br>
        void main() <br>
        { <br>
         clrscr(); <br>
         cout<<"Enter any two number:\n";<br>
         / accessing structure member a and b<br> 
         cin>>st_var.a>>st_var.b; <br>
         // accessing structure member sum, a, and b <br>
         st_var.sum = st_var.a + st_var.b; <br>
         // accessing structure member sum <br>
         cout<<"\nSum of the two number is "<<st_var.sum; <br>
         getch(); 
        } 
         </td></table>
         <p>//output<br>
          Enter any two number:<br>
        3<br>
        4<br>
        sum of the two number is 7
    </p>
    <h3>Simple class construction/ Declaration of class</h3>
      <p>A class is used to specify blue print of similar objects and it combines data and 
        methods for manipulating that data. The data and functions within a class are called 
        members of the class. 
         
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, using the keyword class as follows-<br>
        <table><td>
          Class class_name <br>
 { 
 private: <br>
 Variable declaration; <br>
 Function declaration; <br>
 public: <br>
 Variable declaration; <br>
 Function declaration; <br>
 protected: <br>
 Variable declaration;<br>
 function declaration;<br>
 };
        </td></table>
        Here, class is a C++ keyword; class _name is name of class defined by user. The 
body of class is enclosed within braces and terminated by a semicolon. The class 
body contains the declaration of variables and functions. These function and 
variables are collectively called as members. They are grouped under two sections, 
private and public. By using the keyword "private" we can hide data which can be 
accessed by functions defined within the class. The keyword "public" is used so that 
public members can be accessed by any function even outside the class. The keyword 
private and public are known as visibility labels. By default, the members of class 
are private. In OOP, generally date are made private and functions are made public. 

      </p>
      <h3>Class Definitions</h3>
      <p>When you define a class, you define a blueprint for a data type. This doesn't actually 
        define any data, but it does define what the class name means, that is, what an object 
        of the class will consist of and what operations can be performed on such an object. </p>
<p>A class definition starts with the keyword class followed by the class name; and the 
  class body, enclosed by a pair of curly braces. A class definition must be followed 
  either by a semicolon or a list of declarations. For example, we defined the Box data 
  type using the keyword class as follows − </p>
  <p><table><td>class Box { <br>
    public: <br>
   double length; // Length of a box <br>
   double breadth; // Breadth of a box <br>
   double height; // Height of a box <br>
   }; 
   </td></table>The keyword public determines the access attributes of the members of the class that 
   follows it. A public member can be accessed from outside the class anywhere within 
   the scope of the class object. You can also specify the members of a class 
   as private or protected which we will discuss in a sub-section.
